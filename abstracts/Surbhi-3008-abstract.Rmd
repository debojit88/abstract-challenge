# Abstract

## Title
Profile of patients triaged orange in emergency department of a tertiary referral hospital in India.

## Introduction
Trauma is a major cause of increasing death rates in India and a very important component of trauma care is prioritizing the patients on the basis of their level of sickness/injuries<!-- The / here locks odd. Maybe "based on their level of urgency" or "based on clinical acuity" or "injury severity"-->. Common causes of trauma include road traffic accidents, falls, occupational injuries and assaults. Most trauma deaths occur during the **golden hour** <!-- It's rare to see bold text in abstracts, I suggest you remove the bold-->. So, its important to quickly assess the severity of injury accurately.
In trauma care, how patients are prioritize so that patients are in need of care are seen first<!-- This is not a complete sentence, revise it -->. This whole process of prioritizing the patients is called Triage and these priorities are coded using colors, e.g. **red, orange, yellow and green**, where red assigned to the most urgent patients and green to least urgent patients and orange and yellow comes in between red and green<!-- This is a long and somewhat awkward sentence. Try to make it shorter and more clear-->. After red, orange comes and then yellow and then green<!-- This is repetition and can be removed-->.

Trauma triaging is the use of trauma assessment prioritizing of patients for treatment according to their severity of injury and we use physiological variebles such as **Blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation level and GCS** to assess the level severity injuries of patients in our hospital<!-- This is also somewhat repetitive. You can probably separate the part about vital signs and merge with the rest of the introduction -->.

## Aim
To study the different variables<!-- Try to be a bit more specific here. Is your aim "To describe the characteristics of ...", for example?--> of patients with the history of trauma and patient triage orange.

## Design
Prospective observational study was done on 523<!-- The number of patients is results rather than design--> patients came with history of trauma to the emergency department of a public hospital<!-- Where?-->. Out of these patients, some come directly and some are referred from the other hospital.<!-- This last sentence is not needed-->

## Methods
This was a prospective observational study of trauma patients â‰¥ 18 years coming to emergency department of LoK Nayak Jai Prakash Hoaspital, Delhi<!-- This is partly repetitive. Either keep it here or in Design-->. Mechanism of injury, Details of incident, history, injuries were noted and vital signs were taken<!-- Add one or two sentences on how you analysed the data-->.

## Results
<!-- Use inline r instead of pasting the numbers. -->

```{r}
s= read.csv("triage_orange.csv") # Import the complete raw data instead of this subset
```

We recorded total 3436 patients during the study period with 15.22% of triaged orange. The gender distribution was 78.9% males and 21.2% females. The mean age was 34.6 years. Road Traffic Accident (RTA ) 48.6% was the most common mechanism of injury, followed by Assault (26.2%), fall on ground (11.5%), fall from stairs (11%), fall from height (3.2%), work place injuries (1%). Brain injury was seen in (2.1%).Patients comes directly (87.4%) and 12.4% are referred from other hospital.
Majority of the patients 98.8% with mild head injury GCS (13-15), 0.6% had moderate head injury (9-12) and 0.6% had severe head injury. Median of SBP and DBP (80,120), Median of HR 84bpm, median RR was 19.
1 patient(0.2%) was intubated in our ED. Upper and lower limb were the most common injuries seen (50.7%) of patients followed by facial and head injuries (37.3%), Thoracic injuries(2.7%), Back injuries(2.7%), Abdominal injuries(1.1%) and others (8%).
Among all the adult trauma patients came in ED, 95.5% were discharged in stable condition, 4.2% were discharged against medical advice, 0.6% were transferred to other hospital, Only 1 patient(0.2%) died within the first 24 hour of trauma and the remaining (1.3%) were admitted in the hospital for surgical interventions or conservative management.

```

```{r}
summary(s$hd)
round(prop.table(table(s$hd)),2)*100     # Give percentages w/o decimal places
```

Where 0= Blunt Injuries and 1= Penetrating Injuries.

## Conclusion
Road traffic accidents and falls are the major causes of trauma. Most of the patients in this category are between the age of 18-30 (49%). RTA is the most common mechanism of injury (48%)<!-- Haven't you said this already?-->. Mortality range of patiens triage orange is less than 1% (0.2%). Increasing awareness, early management and proper training of trauma care team and physicians are the need of today`s time. So that, the right patient gets right treatment in shortest duration.
